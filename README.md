# Apoptosis
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pseudoku/Apoptosis/master/Apoptosis_PCB.jpg)
Open-source mechanical keyboard inspired by [Mitosis Keyboard](https://imgur.com/a/mwTFj). Please visit and applaud [reverse_bias](https://www.reddit.com/user/reverse_bias) inspiring many to adapt his amazing project.

## Motivation
Heavy stagger on pinkie columns to help those with shorter pinkies.
Compact, but natural thumb keys.

## Firmware
[Original Mitosis firmware](https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis)
